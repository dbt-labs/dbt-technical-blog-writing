Get started now - comment and claim a post that is [looking for an author](https://github.com/dbt-labs/devhub-writing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Looking+for+author%22)

## How to use this Repo
This repo will serve as an internal and external location for coordinating writing that will live on the dbt Developer Blog (learn more at https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/welcome). 

We welcome contributions from internal (dbt Labs) and community contributors - if you see a topic that interests you, feel free to hop into the issue assign yourself and get writing. NOTE - topics marked as internal will be written by dbt Labs employees.

## Discussions

The discussions section of this repo is where we will propose potential ideas, generate topics and work to create solid ideas for posts. Once a post has solidified to the point where we are reasonably sure we want it to be written, it will be opened as an issue.

**How to get involved**
Do you have an idea for a post? A question about dbt that you think a post might warrant? An interesting theory about any of the topics covered on the blog? Start a discussion and get involved in existing discussions.

## Issues
Issues represent the backlog of posts that are ready to be written. Posts that are labelled "Looking for author" are open. Comment with your interest in writing the post in order to claim a topic to write. 

Opening an issue begins the process of getting a post publish, which will in most cases look as follows:

- A conversation (on github or via call) about what the goals are for the post and why you are interested in writing it
- You put together a draft (in Google Docs) then comment on the post with a link to the draft when ready
- The dbt Labs team member working with you will read + provide feedback to the post. When all of the feedback is addressed, the post will be considered finalized.
- Once finalized, a post will be added to the blog schedule and published no later than two weeks after finalization
